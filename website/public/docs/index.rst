🤖🌊 **aiFlows** embodies the `Flows`_ abstraction and greatly simplifies the design and 
implementation of complex (work)Flows involving humans, AI systems, and tools. It enables:

- 🧩 Modularity: Flows can be stacked like LEGO blocks into arbitrarily nested structures with the complexity hidden behind a message-based interface
- 🤝 Reusability: Flows can be shared publicly on the FlowVerse, readily downloaded and reused as part of different Flows
- 🔀 Concurrency: Being consistent with the Actor model of concurrent computation, Flows are concurrency friendly – a necessary feature for a multi-agent future
