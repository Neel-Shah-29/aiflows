Tutorials
=========================

Welcome to the tutorial section of the Flows library! These tutorials will guide you through the essential features and functionalities of the library, teaching you to efficiently use existing flows, and craft new complex flows for your projects.


Craft New Flows
===============
The library shines when you use existing flows as building blocks towards crafting flows specific to your task.

:ref:`write_atomic`
-------------------
Add more basic building blocks to your toolkit.

:ref:`write_composite`
----------------------
Craft even more complex flows to fit your needs.

:ref:`caching`
-------------------
Save time and money by not executing flows that were already executed before.

:ref:`logging`
-------------------
TODO

:ref:`visualization_toolkit`
----------------------------
Inspect the execution of a flow.


Flow Module Management
======================

Flow is a sharing-oriented platform, empowering users to contribute their personal Flows, called **flow modules**, to Hugging Face.

:ref:`publish_module`
------------------------


Putting It All Together: Complex Flows
======================================

Finally, we will put everything together and guide you through building complex flows. In this section, we will provide practical examples that demonstrate the capabilities of our library:

.. - Daily arxiv summarizer and QA: an example flow that allows the user to receive a summary of what happened on arXiv the day before and engage in QA with an AI agent about the papers.

.. - Self-Refine FlowReAct: A spin around the standard ReAct flow, making it exploit the compositionality of flows.

.. - Competitive Coding Flows (link to github): flows that tackle competitive coding problems that we study in the paper(link to paper)

By the end of these tutorials, you will have a solid understanding of flows and be equipped to harness their power, create custom flows, and tackle complex tasks with ease. So, let's dive in!
