## Getting Started

### [Quick start (ðŸ•“ 5 min)](getting_started/Quick_Start/quick_start.md)

Here, you'll see how you can run inference with your first question-answering Flow, and you can trivially change between vastly different question-answering Flows thanks to the modular abstraction and FlowVerse!

### [Tutorial (ðŸ•“ 20 min)](getting_started/Tutorial/tutorial_landing_page.md)

In this tutorial, we introduce you to the library's features through a walkthrough of how to build useful Flows of gradually increasing complexity. Starting from a vanilla QA Flow, we'll first extend it to a ReAct Flow, then ReAct with human feedback, and finish the tutorial with a version of AutoGPT!

### <a href="ToDoAddLink">Developer's Guide (ðŸ•“ 10 min)</a>

We are constantly optimizing our Flow development workflow (pun intended:). In this short guide, we share our best tips so that you don't have to learn the hard way.

### <a href="ToDoAddLink">Detailed Examples</a>

Many of the recently proposed prompting and collaboration strategies involving tools, humans, and AI models are, in essence, specific Flows (see the figure below). In the link above, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of how to build some representative workflows.
