How to contribute
=====================================

We welcome contributions to the project and accept pull requests of all sorts: documentation, code, bug fixes, etc.
All Github contributors will be explicitly named in release notes of future versions of the library.

We hope to establish flows as a platform to enable collaboration, sharing and reusing of research.
At the heart of this vision is the Flow-verse, a community-driven collection of flows that can be seamlessly remixed into new ideas.
Uploading your work to the Flow-verse is a great way to contribute to the community and to the project.

Last but not least, if you want to prepare educational material (tutorials, videos, etc.) about flows, we would love to hear from you!
We are happy to link to your content from the project website.

If anything is unclear, confusing, or needs to be refactored, please let us know by opening an issue on the repository.
