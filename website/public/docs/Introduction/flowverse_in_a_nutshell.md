The FlowVerse is a repository of Flows (powered by the ðŸ¤— HuggingFace hub) created and shared by our community for everyone to use! With aiFlows, these Flows can be readily downloaded, used, extended or composed into novel, more complex Flows. For the ones using ChatGPT, you could think of them as open-source GPTs(++).
