  "About": {
    "paragraph": "Flows is a framework to orchestrate interactions between LLMs, tools and humans. It is designed to be modular and composable, allowing you to build complex reasoning processes from simple building blocks. The Flow-verse allows you to share your flows with the community, and re-use and combine flows created by other researchers.",
    "Why": [
      "Easy to get started: Create your own Flow in just a few lines of code",
      "Flexible: Anything can be a Flow. With our library you can easily let your LLMs talk to other LLMs, tools, and even humans. Our tutorials show convenient templates that you can adjust to your needs.",
      "Modular and composable: Chain together multiple Flows with smart branching and merging of data. Create deeply nested Flows to build complex reasoning processes from simple building blocks.",
      "Seamlessly extends existing libraries, such as LangChain."
    ],
    "Why2": [
      "Caching: Save time and resources by caching the results of your Flows. Our caching mechanism makes your Flows resilient to crashes and interruptions.",
      "Share data: Our cache is based on an intelligent data and task driven hashing mechanism. You can share cached computations across deeply nested Flow architectures.",
      "Multi-threaded: Our Flow execution engine is multi-threaded and offers a powerful waiting&retrying mechanism to integrate with external services.",
      "Visualization toolkit: Debug and visualize the reasoning process of your LLMs."
