# Quick Start

Welcome to the exciting world of aiFlows! ðŸš€

This quick start tutorial will guide you through running inference with your first question answering Flow using Flows from the FlowVerse. You'll see how you can run inference with your first question answering Flow, and you can trivially change between vastly different question answering Flows thanks to the modular abstraction and FlowVerse!

 The guide is organized in three sections:
1. [Section 1:](#section-1-setting-up-aiflows) Setting up aiFlows
2. [Section 2:](#section-2-running-your-first-qa-flow-using-a-flow-from-the-flowverse) Running your First QA Flow using a Flow from the FlowVerse
3. [Section 3:](#section-3-flowverse-playground-notebook) FlowVerse Playground Notebook


## Section 1: Setting up aiFlows
Start off by installing the aiFlows with the [Setting Up aiFlows Tutorial](./setting_up_aiFlows.md)
#### By the Tutorial's End, I Will Have...
* Installed the aiFlows library successfully
* Established an organized file structure for seamless collaboration within the FlowVerse
* Set up a Hugging Face account for contribution to the FlowVerse (Optional)
* Configured and activated my API keys

## Section 2: Running your First QA Flow using a Flow from the FlowVerse

#### By the Tutorial's End, I Will Have...
* Learned how to pull flows from the FlowVerse
* Run my first flow
* Understood how to pass my API information to a flow



For the remainder of this tutorial, we'll assume you're using either OpenAI or Azure as your API provider.

### Step 1: Explore the FlowVerse
Discover a diverse range of flows, including the [ChatFlowModule](https://huggingface.co/aiflows), by visiting our FlowVerse [here](https://huggingface.co/aiflows). The `ChatAtomicFlow` within the `ChatFlowModule` is a versatile flow that employs a language model (LLM) via an API to generate textual responses to textual inputs.

### Step 2: Pull From the FlowVerse 

To acquire a flow from the FlowVerse, we'll guide you through pulling the `ChatAtomicFlow`. The same process applies to any available flow in the FlowVerse. Pull the flow with aiFlows' `sync_dependencies` function: 

```python
from flows import flow_verse
dependencies = [
{"url": "aiflows/ChatFlowModule", "revision": "main"}
]

flow_verse.sync_dependencies(dependencies)
```

Keep in mind that "aiflows" signifies our organization on Hugging Face, and `ChatFlowModule` is the specific flow module being pulled from the FlowVerse

Each flow on the FlowVerse should include a `pip_requirements.txt` file for external library dependencies (even if it doesn't have any). You can check its dependencies on the FlowVerse. As seen [here](https://huggingface.co/aiflows/ChatFlowModule/blob/main/pip_requirements.txt), the `ChatFlowModule` doesn't have any external dependencies, so we're all set. However, if there are any, make sure to install them.

### Step 3: Run the Flow ! 
Import the flow you've just pulled:
```python
from flow_modules.aiflows.ChatFlowModule import ChatAtomicFlow
```
Set your API information:
```python
api_information = [ApiInfo(backend_used="openai", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))]
# Azure backend
# api_information = ApiInfo(backend_used = "azure",
#                           api_base = os.getenv("AZURE_API_BASE"),
#                           api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"),
#                           api_version =  os.getenv("AZURE_API_VERSION") )
```
Each flow from the FlowVerse should have a `demo.yaml` file, which is a demo configuration of how to instantiate the flow. Give it a quick look (`ChatFlowModule`'s configuration can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/aiflows/ChatFlowModule/blob/main/demo.yaml)) and then load it:

```python
from flows.utils.general_helpers import read_yaml_file
# get demo configuration
cfg = read_yaml_file("flow_modules/aiflows/ChatFlowModule/demo.yaml")
```
If you checked out `demo.yaml`, you will have noticed that the field `flow.backend.api_infos` is set to "???" (see a snippet of here below).
```yaml
flow:  # Overrides the ChatAtomicFlow config
  _target_: aiflows.ChatFlowModule.ChatAtomicFlow.instantiate_from_default_config

  name: "SimpleQA_Flow"
  description: "A flow that answers questions."

  # ~~~ Input interface specification ~~~
  input_interface_non_initialized:
    - "question"

  # ~~~ backend model parameters ~~
  backend:
    _target_: flows.backends.llm_lite.LiteLLMBackend
    api_infos: ???
```

Replace this with your API information like this:
```python
# put the API information in the config
cfg["flow"]["backend"]["api_infos"] = api_information
```

Instantiate your flow:
```python
# ~~~ Instantiate the Flow ~~~
flow = ChatAtomicFlow.instantiate_from_default_config(**cfg["flow"])    
flow_with_interfaces = {
    "flow": flow,
    "input_interface": None,
    "output_interface": None,
}

```
Load some data and run your flow with the `FlowLauncher`:
```python
# ~~~ Get the data ~~~
data = {"id": 0, "question": "What is the capital of France?"} 

# ~~~ Run the Flow ~~~
_, outputs  = FlowLauncher.launch(
        flow_with_interfaces= flow_with_interfaces ,data=data
    )
    # ~~~ Print the output ~~~
flow_output_data = outputs[0]
print(flow_output_data)
```
Congratulations! You've successfully run your first question answering flow!

You can find this example in [runChatAtomicFlow.py](../../examples/quick_start/runChatAtomicFlow.py)

To run it, use the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
cd examples/quick_start/
python runChatAtomicFlow.py
```

Upon execution, the result should appear as follows:
```bash
[{'api_output': 'The capital of France is Paris.'}]
```
