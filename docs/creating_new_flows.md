# Reccomended Workflow for Contributing to a Flow on the FlowVerse

## Case 1: Creating a new Flow

## 1.1. Explore Existing Flows & Engage with the Community
 
**Before initiating a new Flow**, take a moment to explore whether a similar Flow already exists. Delve into our vibrant community on [ðŸ¤²â”‚flow-sharing](https://discord.com/channels/1178627039289430106/1179412176902049832)in Discord to check for existing Flows or reach out to the community on [ðŸŒŠðŸ”®â”‚flow-verse](https://discord.com/channels/1178627039289430106/1178634778128429077). 


## 1.2. Posting your Flow Idea on Flow-Sharing
If the desired Flow doesn't exist, consider crafting a new post in our Discord's [ðŸ¤²â”‚flow-sharing](https://discord.com/channels/1178627039289430106/1179412176902049832).
